Probably you should check that.

The important bit to the lazy hacker is that this is an index of all the LIDAR 
data listed at http://environment.data.gov.uk/ds/survey#/download but in a sane
single index. 

You want to look in the catalog directory. Each file is a .json file describing
available LIDAR data for a 10km x 10km area of the UK. The filename is the 
Easting & Northing on the UK OS National Grid in KM.

In other news, I wrote this text file at a time when people still hoped the
Ordnance Survey would not be sold off. I assume by the time you're reading this
that they've done that. grr.
